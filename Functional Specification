Reprocessing and Trade Application
1.	Market tracker
	Based on output from the EVE market, keep track of buy and sell orders

2.	Reprocessing Assistant
	Based on known reprocessing values, determine what items any given item will reprocess into
	Ideally, include variables such as Refinery Efficiency, the quality of the refinery being used, implants, etc.

3.	Trade Finder
	Based on known buy and sell orders, recommend a trade which represents the greatest ISK return for a given inventory item

4. Sell or Reprocess
	Based on known buy and sell orders, recommend whether an item should be reprocessed or sold

5. Route Planner
	Based on recommended sales & available ships, recommend a route to make the most ISK in one round trip

6. Order Tracker
	Keep track of what buy orders are most often filled

Ultimate aim is that I can have an in-game browser window open, drop an item on the window and it will tell me to sell or reprocess. Ideally it will also be able to advise whether to issue a buy order for that item (ie: I can post a competitive buy order which will net a profit based on sell orders, reprocessing returns, etc).
