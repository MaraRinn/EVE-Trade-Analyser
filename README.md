# Reprocessing and Trade Application

Just like that Geocities web site, this is a work under construction.

# Objectives

1.	**Market tracker**: Based on output from the EVE market, keep track of buy and sell orders
1.	**Reprocessing Assistant**: Based on known reprocessing values, determine what items any given item will reprocess into. Ideally, include variables such as Refinery Efficiency, the quality of the refinery being used, implants, etc.
1.	**Trade Finder**:	Based on known buy and sell orders, recommend a trade which represents the greatest ISK return for a given inventory item
1. **Sell or Reprocess**: Based on known buy and sell orders, recommend whether an item should be reprocessed or sold
1. **Route Planner**: Based on recommended sales & available ships, recommend a route to make the most ISK in one round trip
1. **Order Tracker**: Keep track of what buy orders are most often filled
1. **Market healer**: Based on buy/sell spreads, suggest where to place buy orders for, and where to sell them to, in order to maximise profit

Ultimate aim is that I can nominate an item and the site will tell me to sell or reprocess.
Ideally it will also be able to advise whether to issue a buy order for that item (ie: I can post a competitive buy order which will net a profit based on sell orders, reprocessing returns, etc).
